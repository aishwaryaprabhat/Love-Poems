it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love; \\nthere are those who want love without taking the risk to love or be loved. \\n \\n references \\n(complete references for re\\nprinted poems and thoughts) \\nharper, f. d.

it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

\\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love; \\nthere are those who want love without taking the risk to love or be loved. \\n \\n references \\n(complete references for re\\nprinted poems and thoughts) \\nharper, f. d.

it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love; \\nthere are those who want love without taking the risk to love or be loved. \\n \\n references \\n(complete references for re\\nprinted poems and thoughts) \\nharper, f. d.

\\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love;

it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love; \\nthere are those who want love without taking the risk to love or be loved. \\n \\n references \\n(complete references for re\\nprinted poems and thoughts) \\nharper, f. d.

it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love;

it is total energy directed toward another that \\nmakes one oblivious to time and space; \\nromantic love is that emotion that contradicts and \\nobfuscates rationality, reality, and responsibility; \\nit is that acted-out fantasy realized for the moment \\nand hoped for forever; \\nromantic love is two persons alone in the universe \\nwho prize each other™s presence and consume \\n\\neach other™s essence for every moment and in \\n\\nevery good way; \\nit is the visceral excitement that compels the \\nfulfillment of one™s capacity for sensuality, \\n\\nsensitivity, and possibility; \\nromantic love is that ecstatic, good feeling that \\nprovides a secure feeling, enhances worldly \\n\\nappreciation, promotes confidence, and overhauls \\n\\nphysical and psychological health; \\nit is the force that drives people out of their skin, \\npushes them to a higher level of emotional \\n\\nrealization, and overpowers human control; \\nromantic love is giving for the joy of giving, sharing \\nfor the sake of sharing, and enjoying each other \\n\\nfor the pleasure of each other.  reprinted: harper™s \\nromantica: on peace and romance\\n, 1988. \\nrfrederick douglas harper \\n 20 a phone call™s wait \\n i™ve lived today in wakeš \\nfrom morn to night this date, \\n\\njust to hear your voice once more \\nacross the miles;

we can \\nbe one.  ««« \\n \\nfor those we love the most, we do our best. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nit takes a special person to think and feel of love; it takes a special \\nperson to reveal such things.  ««« \\n \\noften, if a person is in love with you, no matter what you do wrong, \\nﬁyou are right.ﬂ by the same token, if a person hates you, no matter what \\nyou do right, ﬁyou are wrong.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n never accept gifts from one who wants to claim ownership of the \\nreceiver. love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 109 \\n ««« \\n women tend to believe in anything that sounds good, and men \\noften believe in anything that looks good. \\n ««« \\n we can often hate those we know best, and we can often admire those \\nwe know the least.  ««« \\n the aftermath of lost love involves \\nnot just putting pieces back together; \\nit is also the salvaging of old pieces and the creating of new pieces. \\n ««« \\n love is a complicated thing that never stays the same; because love \\nhangs on the vine. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove™s parting is always sweet sorro\\nw, except when there is no sorrow. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 110 \\nromance has a life, and sometimes a lifetime. \\n ««« \\n one who loves too much can one day hate as much. \\n ««« \\n beauty is born; glamour is acquired. \\n ««« \\n there are those who want to get married, but who don™t want to be \\nmarried.  ««« \\n beauty is to appreciate, not necessarily to consume. \\n ««« \\n romantic gifts of appreciation are much better than gifts of obligation \\nor manipulation.  ««« \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 111 \\nwe very often expect too much and tolerate too little from those we \\nprofess to love.  ««« \\n \\nlove is the a priori to creation, and it is the antithesis of war and \\ndestruction.  ««« \\n \\none of the great anxieties of romance is ﬁrejecting or being rejected.ﬂ \\n ««« \\n \\nin romance, the ﬁright personﬂ is \\nthe one about whom you feel excited \\nand around whom you feel comfortable, complete, and at peace. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are those who are desperately in love with those who are not \\nready to be loved. \\n ««« \\n \\nto love, unrestrained, one has to \\nfeel free and be free.  ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 112 \\n true romance is free from and not \\nfraught with maybe™s, might™s, and \\nmay™s. true romance rests on quality \\ntime shared and not on empty words. \\n ««« \\n \\nthe test of romance is one of mutual infatuation; however, the test of \\nlove is a test of lasting commitment to each other. \\n ««« \\n \\nlove is the willingness of two persons to \\nlet things happen that are \\nmeant to be, and not to \\nmake things happen unnaturally. \\n ««« \\n there are times in people™s lives wh\\nen they should do nothing except \\nthink about things about which they have not taken the time to think. \\n ««« \\n in a relationship, when a person learns to lie as habit, it is difficult for \\nthat person to know and tell the truth. \\n ««« \\n one who tends to lie is likely to belie\\nve anything that seems to be true. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 113 \\n ««« \\n there is no need to control others when you can control yourself. there \\nis no need to manipulate others when you can manipulate your own \\n\\nbehavior.  ««« \\n \\nanger has no virtue in the destruction of sacred things. \\n ««« \\n many a person very often forget the living, once the living is dead. \\n ««« \\n in some relationships, people can ge\\nt angry for nothing and stay angry \\nforever.  ««« \\n you have to know what you want and \\nyou have to go get it; you have to \\nknow what you don™t want, and you have to keep it from getting you. \\n ««« \\n frederick douglas harper \\n 114 \\na major difference between boys and men is that boys like to play too \\nmuch and men like to work too much. \\n ««« \\n \\nmany times, true answers come not with words but with time and \\nactions.  ««« \\n \\nusers tend to be losers; they use other people, and, in their greed, they \\ntend to get used. \\n ««« \\n \\nman cannot be greater than woman,\\n because he comes from woman. \\n ««« \\n \\na person who has not\\n learned to love a child is one who has not learned \\nto love self.  ««« \\n \\nyou™ll never know what you are missing if you don™t realize what you \\nare missing, and you™ll never know wh\\nat you have or could have if you \\ndon™t appreciate its value. \\nlove poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 115 \\n ««« \\n you never can tell where the spirit of god might lead two loving souls \\nor one; however, don™t look to the p\\nast except to appreciate and evaluate; \\nconcentrate on and live in the present, and seldom look forward except to \\n\\nplan.  the following thoughts are reprinted from frederick \\ndouglas harper™s poems on love and life, 1985.   treat true love with kindness although caution, for it seldom visits your \\ndoorstep.  ««« \\n the goal of marriage is not to have a happy marriage, necessarily, but to \\nbe happy in marriage. \\n ««« \\n in planning marriage, it is wise to know your mate™s pedigree and \\nhistory. \\n ««« \\nfrederick douglas harper \\n 116 \\n jealousy is the mother of hatred, and hatred is the mother of destruction. \\n\\n ««« \\n \\nnobody can be truly used in so-calle\\nd love unless that person submits to being used.  ««« \\n \\nloss of love and affection is not just a personal experience, it is a \\nhuman experience. \\n ««« \\n \\npeople don™t make love; love mak\\nes peoplešor at least it should. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are many lovable qualities in\\n people besides their physical \\nattributes.  ««« \\n \\nthe greatest love is the love of a lost lovešso take not for granted those \\nwhom you profess to love. \\n love poems of frederick douglas harper \\n 117 \\n««« \\n \\na woman is god™s most sacred trustee and temple of life. \\n ««« \\n \\nthere are some people who want to be in love without falling in love; \\nthere are those who want love without taking the risk to love or be loved. \\n \\n references \\n(complete references for re\\nprinted poems and thoughts) \\nharper, f. d.
